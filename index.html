            <div class="title-thing LightCoral"> <h2> Paella </h2> </div>
            <p>A classic Spanish rice dish originating from Valencia, cooked with saffron-infused rice, and typically mixed with a variety of ingredients like seafood (such as shrimp, mussels, and squid), chicken, and sometimes chorizo. The dish is cooked slowly to allow the flavors to meld, resulting in a hearty, flavorful meal that embodies the richness of Mediterranean cuisine. The crispy layer of rice at the bottom, called "socarrat," is especially prized.</p>

            <div class="title-thing SteelBlue"> <h2> Tacos al Pastor </h2> </div>
            <p>A beloved Mexican street food, made from pork that is marinated in a mixture of chilies, spices, and pineapple juice, then slow-cooked on a vertical spit (similar to shawarma). The meat is sliced thinly and served in warm, soft corn tortillas, topped with fresh pineapple, chopped onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime. Often paired with a spicy salsa, Tacos al Pastor offer a perfect balance of savory, sweet, and tangy flavors.</p>
